Create the next file: "TestJUnitExerciseOne.java" at "JUnitExerciseOne.zip"
Test each method by doing the assigned task creating a new object 
Use assertEquals sentences 

We create the TestRunner.java class to execute the test cases. It contains the main() method in which we run the TestJunitExerciseOne.java 
class using the runClasses() method of the JUnitCore. In this method, we pass the class file of the TestJunitTestCaseExample.java. 
The result returned by the runClasses() method will store into the result variable of type Result.

Now, we will run the TestRunner.java class to execute the test cases. 
We will get the output true when the test cases are passed and false when the test cases are not passed.
