Create a file for named "TestLogic.java" for "JUnitExerciseTwo.zip" 

In this file:

you'll use JUnit 4, so there is no need to inherit TestCase class. 

The main testing code is written in the testFindMax() method of "Calculation.java". 

Create this test to try it with negative and positive numbers.

And if the testing find some issues with Calculation code, correct them.
