Here, we are going to create an example of mock objects. 
The following steps where used to create an example of testing using Mockito with JUnit.

Step 1: Create an interface named ToDoService that contains an unimplemented method.
Step 2: Now, create an implementation class named ToDoBusiness for ToDoService interface.
Step 3: Create a JUnit test case named ToDoBusinessMock for unit testing.

To run this properly we need to make sure of our dependencies. In this case is needed mockito-core in our pom.xml

The output shows that the test is successfully running. 
It is also showing that object is available in the list, i.e., "Use Hibernate."
