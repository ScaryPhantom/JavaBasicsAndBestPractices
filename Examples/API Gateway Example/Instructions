The dependencies that you need to add to this project are:

Spring Boot DevTools
Spring Boot Actuator
Eureka Discovery Client
Gateway

Gateway: Provides a simple, yet effective way to route to APIs and provide cross cutting concerns to them such  as security, monitoring/metrics and resiliency

This project works with the EurekaExercise, and the order to execute the programs are the next one:

name-server
api-gateway
currency-exchange-conversion
currency-conversion-service

And if you watch your Eureka server you'll see your running services

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
application.properties explanation:

spring.application.name=api-gateway

//Usually the port used by gateway is 8765
server.port=8765

//This register the service an Eureka client on the proper port
eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka

//If we uncomment the below line we should be able to watch our other services running at the URLS "Initial" from below
#spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.enabled=true

//This line if we uncomment it is used to our URL to can be able to be written in lower case without give us an error and still working fine
#spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.lowerCaseServiceId=true

spring.sleuth.sampler.probability=1.0
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//This are some URLS to use when we use our application to see how it works

Some of these URLs may be complex to write by hand:
