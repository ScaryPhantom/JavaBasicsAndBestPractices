You'll need to get git 
After download it 
You need to create the repository a the folder without any spaces oh the path by the next commands:

mkdir git-localconfig-repo
cd git-localconfig-repo
git init
dir

uncompress the file git-localconfig-repo.zip file and copy the file limits-service.properties to your new folder that you created
after that introduce this commands:

git add *
git commit -m "adding limits-service.properties"

Once you do that, continue to copy the rest of the files you uncomressed on your new foler

After modify your file "application.properties" that you uncompressed from your spring-cloud-config-server.zip 
and change it accordingly to your path as:

spring.application.name=spring-cloud-config-server
server.port=8888
spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri=file:///C:/Users/home/Desktop/yourProject/git-repo

Run your application and visit: 

http://localhost:8888/limits-service/default

where you'll find your default configuration

try new configurations as:
http://localhost:8888/limits-service/dev
http://localhost:8888/limits-service/aq

After doing that go to your application "limits-service" and run them at the same time
Now you'll see the new configurations from your preference editing the lines marked on the explanation file 
selecting the diferent profiles
