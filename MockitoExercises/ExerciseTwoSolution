In the code, we have created a spy of the ArrayList class and checked its size. The size of the list is zero, it means the list is empty. 
After checking the list size, we have added an item ("Mockito") in the List.

Now, the size has increased by one as we have discussed that the spy creates a partial mock of the real object.

The spy() method let the real action continue to happen except the stuff where they want to change the behavior. 
It means spy() method allows us to keep track of what is happening with the real object as well as allow us to overrides a specific behavior.
