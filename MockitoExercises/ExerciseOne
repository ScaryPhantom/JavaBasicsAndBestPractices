In this exercise we are going to mock a List.get() method. 
To use the get() method, we need to pass a value (number) in it.

Step 1: Create a test class named TestList for mocking the List.get() method
Step 2: create a public void method named testList_get()
Step 3: Mock a list 
Step 4: Find a way to get a value from index 0 and return the String "Mockito"
Step 5: Introduce the properly assert sentence
Step 6: Print out the result

The output should show that the test is successfully running when the index value of the list is 0, and it returns the given String, i.e., Mockito.
