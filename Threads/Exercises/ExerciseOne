We could have two people using a joint bank account at the same time. Create and start two threads that use same BankAccount 
instance and an initial balance of $1000.00. One will deposit $300.00 into the bank account, and then withdraw $50.00.The other 
will deposit $203.75 and then withdraw $100.00. This is the base class, modify it and check the Main class

public class BankAccount {

    private double balance;
    private String accountNumber;

    public BankAccount(String accountNumber, double initialBalance) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        balance -= amount;
    }
}
