Create a simple CRUD for next operations:

POST api/schools Save a new school into the database 
GET api/schools Fetch all the schools 
PUT api/schools Update the exsiting school 
DELETE api/schools/:id Delete existing school from the database by its ID

This are the dependencies that you'll need: 

<dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        </dependency>
</dependencies>

You'll need to change your application properties:

#Database connection strings
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost/springboot_mongodb_crud

Create a POJO class School having the following attributes: 
id, name, establishmentYear, availableCourses, and strength and generates its Getters and Settersâ€¦

Steps:

Create a SchoolRepository interface which extends MongoRepository.

Declare all the methods in the SchoolService interface to perform the CRUD  operation on the school data.

SchoolServiceImpl is the implementation class of the SchoolService interface.

Create SchoolController class to handle the user request to perform create, read, update, and delete operation and response accordingly.
